# CSS Loaders & Spinners
A general situation that we all might face while going through websites/apps is to wait for some progress or something to get loaded. A most simple solution in such scenarios is to use a loader or spinner to indicate users that something is loading in the background.
Considering this, I tried to create a library having a collection of such loaders/spinners. There are no image dependencies for this library. It's developed using pure CSS. Hence it will load fast and is easily customizable too.

All loader are created in single tag html
```html


<div class="loader"></div>


```
